TITLE: Black Command-Line Exclusion and Inclusion Options

DESCRIPTION: Documentation for Black's command-line options related to file and directory exclusion and inclusion during recursive searches.

SOURCE: https://github.com/psf/black/blob/main/docs/usage\_and\_configuration/the\_basics.md#\_snippet\_10



LANGUAGE: APIDOC

CODE:

```

Option: --exclude

&nbsp; Description: A regular expression that matches files and directories that should be excluded on recursive searches. An empty value means no paths are excluded. Use forward slashes for directories on all platforms (Windows, too). By default, Black also ignores all paths listed in .gitignore. Changing this value will override all default exclusions.

&nbsp; Default Exclusions: \['.direnv', '.eggs', '.git', '.hg', '.ipynb\_checkpoints', '.mypy\_cache', '.nox', '.pytest\_cache', '.ruff\_cache', '.tox', '.svn', '.venv', '.vscode', '\_\_pypackages\_\_', '\_build', 'buck-out', 'build', 'dist', 'venv']

&nbsp; Notes: If the regular expression contains newlines, it is treated as a verbose regular expression, useful in pyproject.toml.

```



LANGUAGE: APIDOC

CODE:

```

Option: --extend-exclude

&nbsp; Description: Like --exclude, but adds additional files and directories on top of the default values instead of overriding them.

```



LANGUAGE: APIDOC

CODE:

```

Option: --force-exclude

&nbsp; Description: Like --exclude, but files and directories matching this regex will be excluded even when they are passed explicitly as arguments. Useful for programmatic invocation (e.g., pre-commit hooks).

```



LANGUAGE: APIDOC

CODE:

```

Option: --stdin-filename

&nbsp; Description: The name of the file when passing it through stdin. Useful to ensure Black respects --force-exclude when using stdin.

```



LANGUAGE: APIDOC

CODE:

```

Option: --include

&nbsp; Description: A regular expression that matches files and directories that should be included on recursive searches. An empty value means all files are included regardless of the name. Use forward slashes for directories on all platforms (Windows, too). Overrides all exclusions, including from .gitignore and command line options.

&nbsp; Default Inclusions: \['.pyi', '.ipynb']

```

```

hook global WinSetOption filetype=python %{

&nbsp;   set-option window formatcmd 'black -q  -'

}

```



----------------------------------------



TITLE: Black Preview Style: List/Dict Unpacking Indentation - After

TITLE: Black's Line Wrapping for Long Function Calls

DESCRIPTION: Illustrates how Black wraps long function calls by placing arguments on separate indented lines if the entire call doesn't fit on one line, improving readability for complex expressions.

TITLE: Execute Simple Python Print Statement with Time Measurement

DESCRIPTION: This snippet demonstrates a basic Python print function. It also includes the `%%time` IPython magic command, which measures the execution time of the entire cell in an IPython environment (like Jupyter notebooks). This is useful for quick performance profiling.

TITLE: Black's Removal of Backslashes for Short Conditions

DESCRIPTION: Demonstrates Black's preference for parentheses over backslashes. For short logical expressions that can fit on a single line, it removes backslashes and consolidates the expression.

LANGUAGE: python

CODE:

```

TITLE: Python Grammar: Expanded Variable Argument List Definition

DESCRIPTION: Presents the complete, expanded grammar rule for `varargslist`, which describes the parsing of function arguments without type hints, covering positional-only, positional-or-keyword, variable positional, and keyword-only arguments.

SOURCE: https://github.com/psf/black/blob/main/src/blib2to3/Grammar.txt#\_snippet\_5



LANGUAGE: Python Grammar

CODE:

```

varargslist: vfpdef \['=' test ](',' vfpdef \['=' test])\* ',' '/' \[',' \[

&nbsp;                    ((vfpdef \['=' test] ',')\* ('\*' \[vname] (',' vname \['=' test])\*

&nbsp;                           \[',' \['\*\*' vname \[',']]] | '\*\*' vname \[','])

&nbsp;                           | vfpdef \['=' test] (',' vfpdef \['=' test])\* \[','])

&nbsp;                    ]] | ((vfpdef \['=' test] ',')\*

&nbsp;                    ('\*' \[vname] (',' vname \['=' test])\*  \[',' \['\*\*' vname \[',']]]| '\*\*' vname \[','])

&nbsp;                    | vfpdef \['=' test] (',' vfpdef \['=' test])\* \[','])

TITLE: Black's Removal of Backslashes for Long Conditions

DESCRIPTION: Illustrates how Black replaces backslashes with parentheses for long logical expressions, wrapping them across multiple lines. This improves readability and avoids the brittle nature of backslashes in Python's grammar.

SOURCE: https://github.com/psf/black/blob/main/docs/the\_black\_code\_style/current\_style.md#\_snippet\_4



LANGUAGE: python

CODE:

```

&nbsp;   some\_long\_rule1

&nbsp;   and some\_long\_rule2

):

&nbsp;   ...

TITLE: Python Grammar: Helper Rules for Variable Arguments

DESCRIPTION: Defines auxiliary grammar rules used within `varargslist` for parsing variable names (`vname`) and variable function parameter definitions (`vfpdef`, `vfplist`).

SOURCE: https://github.com/psf/black/blob/main/src/blib2to3/Grammar.txt#\_snippet\_6



LANGUAGE: Python Grammar

CODE:

```

vname: NAME

vfpdef: vname | '(' vfplist ')'

vfplist: vfpdef (',' vfpdef)\* \[',']

```

TITLE: Black Formatter: Empty Line Handling in Python Functions

DESCRIPTION: This example demonstrates how Black reformats Python code to manage empty lines. It shows that empty lines within parenthesized expressions are removed, while single empty lines inside functions are preserved. It also illustrates how Black enforces proper spacing between function definitions, ensuring consistency and adherence to PEP 8 guidelines.

SOURCE: https://github.com/psf/black/blob/main/docs/the\_black\_code\_style/current\_style.md#\_snippet\_5



LANGUAGE: python

CODE:

```

\# in:



def function(

&nbsp;   some\_argument: int,



&nbsp;   other\_argument: int = 5,

) -> EmptyLineInParenWillBeDeleted:







&nbsp;   print("One empty line above me will be kept!")



def this\_is\_okay\_too():

&nbsp;   print("No empty line here")

\# out:



def function(

&nbsp;   some\_argument: int,

&nbsp;   other\_argument: int = 5,

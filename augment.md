✅ Full architecture for BTC and USDT
✅ FX handling for USD/KES
✅ Rate limits and M-Pesa quirks
✅ Compliance and AML/STR handling
✅ Gas fee management
✅ Load testing and production readiness
✅ Security and monitoring
✅ Business logic for fees
✅ References to relevant open-source GitHub projects for each layer

Consider this your MVP battle plan. Feel free to save it, share it with devs, or feed sections into AI coding tools.

🚀 Crypto-Fiat Payment Processor - Kenya Market
🌍 Vision
A web-first dual-account ecosystem for Kenya that:

Accepts BTC and USDT payments

Settles to merchants in KES via M-Pesa

Allows individuals to buy, store, and spend crypto

Complies with CBK/CMA requirements

Provides modern web interfaces for users, merchants, and admins

✅ Blockchains: BTC + USDT
USDT
Support Ethereum USDT (ERC20):

Node providers: Infura, Alchemy

Libraries:

Web3.py → https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

Support Tron USDT (TRC20):

Node providers: TronGrid

Libraries:

Tronpy → https://tronpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

BTC
Support on-chain BTC transactions:

Libraries:

bitcoinlib → https://github.com/1200wd/bitcoinlib

Electrum server (for efficient balance checks) → https://github.com/romanz/electrs

Transaction Monitoring
Implement:

min 3 confirmations for BTC

min 3 blocks for ERC20

min 20 blocks for Tron

Use exponential backoff for polling.

🔄 Cross-Chain Bridges
⚠️ Cross-chain bridging is risky.

For MVP, keep funds separate per network.

Don’t try bridging USDT ERC20 <-> TRC20 unless:

you partner with trusted providers like:

Multichain → https://github.com/anyswap/Anyswap-V3-Contracts

you can manage bridge security risks.

💵 FX Rates & Fiat Conversion
Real-Time USD/KES Conversion
Integrate:

exchangerate-api → https://www.exchangerate-api.com/

or Forex Python → https://github.com/MicroPyramid/forex-python

Strategy:
✅ Cache rates every minute.
✅ Add a buffer margin (e.g. 0.5%) for volatility.
✅ Always store rates in DB for audit trails.

⚖️ Fee Calculation
Store all fee structures in DB:

Type	Example Values
Crypto withdrawal	0.5%
FX margin	0.25-1%
M-Pesa settlement	30 KES + % commission
Merchant fee	1-2% per payment

Implement fees in:

bash
Copy
Edit
services/payment_service.py
📲 M-Pesa Integration
APIs:
M-Pesa Daraja → https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/

PesaPal → https://developer.pesapal.com/

Challenges:
✅ Rate limits (~200 tx/hr)
✅ Approval delays for B2C production
✅ Daily transaction limits per shortcode

Implementation:
✅ Queue settlements via Celery or Redis queues.
✅ Store all API calls for audit logs.
✅ Validate phone numbers strictly:

patterns = [
    r'^\+254[17]\d{8}$',
    r'^254[17]\d{8}$',
    r'^0[17]\d{8}$'
]
🔐 Security Blueprint
JWT auth (short-lived access + refresh tokens)

Encrypted private key storage

PBKDF2-HMAC encryption

Webhook signature validation for:

M-Pesa

crypto node callbacks

Rate limiting:

e.g. slowapi → https://github.com/laurentS/slowapi

Logging:

structured logs in JSON

audit logs for:

logins

payments

settlements

📝 Compliance & AML
Core Requirements:
CBK compliance:

reports on crypto flows

suspicious transaction reporting

KYC onboarding:

name

phone

ID photo

live selfie

Transaction monitoring:

flag high-value transfers

suspicious patterns

Suggested Tools:
custom rule engine:

bash
Copy
Edit

Edit
from decimal import Decimal
M-Pesa sandbox ≠ production behavior

Tron has higher block confirmation times under load

KYC requirements can change abruptly

Bridges can fail and cause fund losses

High fees on Ethereum

Rate limits on FX APIs

Slippage risk if crypto prices swing during conversion

⭐ Final Thoughts
→ This refined plan leaves nothing critical to chance.
→ It’s fully ready to feed into AI coding agents (Claude, Devin, Copilot, Cursor) because:

The blueprint is modular

Tasks are clearly defined

Testing loops are built-in

You’re set up to build a truly production-grade crypto-fiat processor for Kenya.

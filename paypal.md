üìù Key Patterns to Borrow from PayPal
‚úÖ Idempotency

All payment endpoints should accept an idempotency key to prevent duplicate payments:

http
Copy
Edit
POST /api/payments
Idempotency-Key: abc-123
PayPal enforces this to avoid double charges on retry.

‚úÖ Webhook Security

PayPal signs every webhook and publishes how to verify signatures.

Exactly what you‚Äôll do for:

M-Pesa webhooks

blockchain transaction events

‚úÖ Error Handling

PayPal consistently returns:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "message": "Amount is required",
  "details": [...]
}
Super useful pattern for your FastAPI error responses.

‚úÖ Transaction State Machines

PayPal has clear payment states:

CREATED

APPROVED

COMPLETED

FAILED

Implement similar state transitions in your:

lua
Copy
Edit
transactions.status
‚úÖ Currency Handling

All monetary fields are:

stored as decimals

carry currency codes (e.g. USD, KES)

üî• How This Helps Your Project
Borrowing PayPal patterns:
‚úÖ reduces financial bugs
‚úÖ improves compliance
‚úÖ makes your API friendlier for third-party integrations
‚úÖ avoids pitfalls in high-volume payment processing

‚úÖ My Honest Opinion
Even though PayPal doesn‚Äôt release full backend processors:
‚Üí Their code and patterns are excellent references for any payment system.

If you:

design APIs the way PayPal does

model transactions as state machines

implement idempotency and webhooks correctly

‚Üí you‚Äôll be building a processor on par with industry best practices.

Payment API design


ChatGPT said:
Excellent. Let‚Äôs dive in.

You want to design your crypto-fiat Payment API with the same professional rigor as PayPal‚Äôs. Below is a full guide for Payment API design, inspired by PayPal‚Äôs best practices and tailored to your crypto-fiat processor.

‚úÖ Payment API Design - Crypto-Fiat Processor
‚≠ê High-Level Principles
‚úÖ RESTful architecture
‚úÖ Idempotency to avoid duplicate payments
‚úÖ State machine for transaction lifecycle
‚úÖ Hypermedia (HATEOAS) optional for client guidance
‚úÖ Precise monetary values ‚Üí always use Decimal
‚úÖ Detailed error messages for debugging
‚úÖ Audit logs for all payment activity

‚û°Ô∏è Core Payment Flow
Your flow should look like this:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Merchant/Customer initiates payment
        ‚îÇ
    [POST /api/payments]
        ‚îÇ
‚Üê Payment resource is created:
    - status = PENDING
    - unique transaction_id
        ‚îÇ
Backend triggers:
    - blockchain payment
    - transaction monitoring
    - possible FX conversion
        ‚îÇ
Upon confirmation:
    - status ‚Üí CONFIRMED
    - settlement queued to M-Pesa
        ‚îÇ
Once settlement completes:
    - status ‚Üí SETTLED
üîπ Payment Object (Transaction Resource)
A single payment resource should capture:

Field	Description
transaction_id	UUID for the transaction
status	One of: PENDING, CONFIRMED, SETTLED, FAILED
created_at	Timestamp
updated_at	Timestamp
payment_method	e.g. BTC, USDT-ERC20, USDT-TRC20
amount_crypto	Amount in crypto (Decimal)
amount_fiat	KES amount (Decimal)
exchange_rate	USD/KES rate used
blockchain_tx_hash	Optional, if blockchain payment exists
mpesa_reference	Optional, if settlement happened
customer_id	FK to User
merchant_id	FK to Merchant
idempotency_key	Request idempotency

‚úÖ Endpoints Design
‚û§ POST /api/payments
‚Üí Create a new payment attempt.

Example request:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "amount_usdt": "100.000000",
  "recipient_address": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D",
  "network": "ethereum",
  "merchant_id": "uuid-of-merchant",
  "idempotency_key": "abcd-1234"
}
Idempotency key required for safety:

http
Copy
Edit
POST /api/payments
Idempotency-Key: abcd-1234
Example response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "transaction_id": "d34f5c93-7f0e-41b0-87fa-120b045c9a8e",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "links": [
    {
      "href": "/api/payments/d34f5c93-7f0e-41b0-87fa-120b045c9a8e",
      "rel": "self",
      "method": "GET"
    }
  ]
}
‚û§ GET /api/payments/{transaction_id}
‚Üí Retrieve payment status.

Example response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "transaction_id": "d34f5c93-7f0e-41b0-87fa-120b045c9a8e",
  "status": "CONFIRMED",
  "amount_usdt": "100.000000",
  "amount_kes": "13050.00",
  "exchange_rate": "130.5000",
  "blockchain_tx_hash": "0xabcd...",
  "mpesa_reference": "MPESA123456"
}
‚û§ GET /api/payments
‚Üí List payments for the user or merchant.

Optional filters:

status

created_from

created_to

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
GET /api/payments?status=CONFIRMED&created_from=2025-07-01
‚û§ PATCH /api/payments/{transaction_id}
‚Üí Optional. For updating:

settlement details

blockchain tx hash

üîí Idempotency Logic
Every payment creation must store an idempotency key:

Client sends:

http
Copy
Edit
Idempotency-Key: abcd-1234
Server logic:

Check if a payment with same key exists

If yes, return existing transaction

Otherwise, process new payment

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
existing = db.query(Transaction).filter_by(idempotency_key="abcd-1234").first()
if existing:
    return existing_transaction_response
else:
    # proceed with blockchain transfer
üîÑ Transaction Status Lifecycle
Status	Description
PENDING	Payment initiated, blockchain transaction not yet confirmed
CONFIRMED	Payment confirmed on-chain
SETTLED	Merchant received KES in M-Pesa/bank
FAILED	Payment attempt failed

This is how PayPal models their transactions:

CREATED

APPROVED

COMPLETED

FAILED

üí£ Error Handling Patterns
Instead of generic errors, return structured JSON:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "message": "Amount must be positive",
  "details": [
    {
      "field": "amount_usdt",
      "issue": "Must be greater than zero"
    }
  ]
}
HTTP status codes:

400 ‚Üí validation errors

401 ‚Üí unauthorized

409 ‚Üí idempotency conflict

500 ‚Üí internal errors

üìë Example Pydantic Schemas
Request
python
Copy
Edit
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, validator
from decimal import Decimal
from typing import Literal, Optional

class PaymentRequest(BaseModel):
    amount_usdt: Decimal = Field(..., gt=0, decimal_places=6)
    recipient_address: str = Field(..., min_length=30)
    network: Literal['ethereum', 'tron', 'bitcoin']
    merchant_id: Optional[str] = None
    idempotency_key: str

    @validator('amount_usdt')
    def check_amount(cls, v):
        if v <= 0:
            raise ValueError('Amount must be positive')
        return v
Response
python
Copy
Edit
class PaymentResponse(BaseModel):
    transaction_id: str
    status: str
    amount_usdt: Decimal
    amount_kes: Optional[Decimal]
    exchange_rate: Optional[Decimal]
    blockchain_tx_hash: Optional[str]
    mpesa_reference: Optional[str]

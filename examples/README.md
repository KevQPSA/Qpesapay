## 🎯 Usage Guidelines

### For AI Development
1. **Reference before implementing** - Always check examples/ for existing patterns
2. **Follow established patterns** - Use the same structure and conventions
3. **Adapt, don't copy** - Modify examples to fit specific requirements
4. **Update examples** - Add new patterns when creating novel implementations

### For Human Developers
1. **Study patterns first** - Understand the architectural decisions
2. **Follow Sandi Metz principles** - Small objects, single responsibility
3. **Maintain consistency** - Use the same patterns across features
4. **Document deviations** - Explain why you deviated from patterns

## 🔒 Financial System Considerations

### Security Patterns
- All examples use proper encryption for sensitive data
- Private keys are never exposed or logged
- Input validation is comprehensive and consistent
- Audit logging is implemented for all financial operations

### Compliance Patterns
- KYC/AML integration points are clearly marked
- Transaction monitoring hooks are included
- Regulatory reporting capabilities are demonstrated
- Data retention policies are implemented

### Error Handling Patterns
- Financial operations have proper rollback mechanisms
- Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- Failed transactions are properly logged and tracked
- Recovery procedures are documented

## 📊 Pattern Categories

### 🟢 Production Ready
Examples marked as production-ready have been thoroughly tested and follow all security and compliance requirements.

### 🟡 Development Template
Template examples that need customization for specific use cases but follow the correct architectural patterns.

### 🔴 Experimental
Experimental patterns that demonstrate concepts but may need additional validation before production use.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Browse by category** - Find examples relevant to your feature
2. **Read the pattern documentation** - Understand the architectural decisions
3. **Adapt to your needs** - Modify examples for your specific requirements
4. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure all security and compliance requirements are met
5. **Update documentation** - Add new patterns when you create them

## 📝 Contributing New Examples
